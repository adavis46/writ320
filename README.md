# WRIT 320: Technical Writing
**Offered Online in Full Summer 2019 and Fall 2019**

This course provides an intensive study of technical style and information design in various formats, modes, and platforms. Students gain experience developing technical reports, iterating user documentation, and representing complex information to varied audiences.

## Learning Outcomes
- Foster a sense of writing to multiple audiences for various purposes in real world contexts
- Create contexts for writing that are real and sophisticated, and that require collaborative action
- Construct profiles for technical audiences and users of information
- Collaborate with colleagues to manage dynamic technical document
- Iterate technical documents at each stage of the development process
- Deliver products that are precise and free of mechanical errors that inhibit meaning
- Design content that is universally accessible and adaptable from the concept stage to the execution stage
- Utilize industry-standard platforms, languages, and tools in the composition process
- Apply ethics to technical communication scenarios
- Reflect on the technical communicator's role in the process of knowledge generation

## Deliverables
All major course deliverables are components of a semester-length technical documentation project. Students will select a process, experiment, project, or other complex system from their own field and develop a suit of multimodal technical documentation for it. 

1. **Proposal Memo:** One-page proposal outlining the basic framework for the documentation project, including purpose, message, users, and preliminary document specifications. 
2. **User Analysis Report:** 1200 word analysis of the identified users for the documentation, including background, need, variability, barriers to access, and a preliminary system map. 
3. **Task Orientation Report and Topic Model:** 1200 word description of user goals in different support scenarios and a complete outline of all topic sets. 
4. **Technical Documentation Final Product:** Variable-length technical documentation delivered as a print manual or online user guide.  
5. **Technical Documentation Final Product: Secondary Mode:** Technical documentation product delivered in a different mode; for example, a print manual delivered as an online user guide, or an online user guide delivered as a mobile app. 
6. **Evaluation and Usability Test Design:** Study designs for product evaluation based on usability testing models and preliminary analysis of testing validity. 

## Textbook

*Developing Quality Technical Information: A Handbook for Writers and Editors,* 3rd Edition. IBM Press, 2014. 

## Tools and Languages

Students will learn how to use a variety of technical writing tools and languages. Though application may vary based on each student's individual product, some examples include:

- **LaTeX** (Lamport TeX): Plaintext markup document preparation system
- **Markdown**: lightweight plaintext markup language
- **XML** (Extensible Markup Language): markup language that defines rules for encoding document format
- **Git and Github**: distributed version control and project management
- **MediaWiki**: platform and markup language for Wikipedia and other large wikis. 
  
Other software and web tools students might use include:

 - **Adobe Framemaker and InDesign**
 - **GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)**
 - **Virtual Studio Code/Other IDEs**
 - **Microsoft Visio/Other diagramming tools**

## Relevance and Utility

Technical writing is a useful and marketable skill for most majors, even for those not typically associated with "technical" information. Some examples might include:

- **English**: English Literature or Creative Writing majors might eschew technical writing at first, but if they enter the field of Publishing or ever want to publish their own book, iterating and document version control over a long-term project is an essential skill. Technical writing experience can make a job candidate stand out among other English majors. 
- **Engineering**: Engineers must be able to communicate complex ideas clearly to different audiences. All engineers rely on precise documentation and an engineer who can produce his or her own coherent documentation is more valuable than one who must rely on a secondary technical writer. 
- **Computer Science**: Like engineering, computer science relies on documentation. Additionally, software code is a form of technical writing. Developers with training in technical writing produce clearer, more consistent code and understand the importance of documenting their process. Generally it's easier to teach a good writer to code than it is to teach a good coder to write. 
- **Hard Sciences**: Technical Writing is a great complement to our new Scientific Writing class. While Scientific Writing is more about situation-specific application, Technical Writing provides a process and heuristics for large-scale project documentation. 
- **Social Sciences**: Documentation is a huge part of the social sciences, whether it comes in the form of government reporting for social workers or IRB compliance for psychologists. Technical Writing provides a framework for writing projects that include many moving parts and multiple authors and auidences.
